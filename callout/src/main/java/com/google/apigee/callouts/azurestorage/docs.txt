When constructing a SAS for Azure Blob service, the strring to sign is like this:

StringToSign = signedPermissions + "\n" +
               signedStart + "\n" +
               signedExpiry + "\n" +
               canonicalizedResource + "\n" +
               signedIdentifier + "\n" +
               signedIP + "\n" +
               signedProtocol + "\n" +
               signedVersion + "\n" +
               signedResource + "\n" +
               signedSnapshotTime + "\n" +
               signedEncryptionScope + "\n" +
               rscc + "\n" +
               rscd + "\n" +
               rsce + "\n" +
               rscl + "\n" +
